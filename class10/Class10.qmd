## The PDB Database 

The main repository of biomolecular structure data is called the [Protein Data Bank](http://www.rcsb.org/) (PDB for short). It is the second oldest database (after GenBank). 

What is currently in the PDB? We can access current composition stats [here](https://www.rcsb.org/stats/summary) 

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary (1).csv")
head(stats)
```


> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
x <- stats$X.ray
# Substitute comma for nothing 
y <- gsub(",", "", stats$X.ray)

# Convert to numeric 
sum(as.numeric(y))
```

Turn this snippet into a function so I can use it any time I have this comma problem (i.e. the other columns of this `stats` table)

```{r}
comma.sum <- function(x) {
  # Substitute comma for nothing 
y <- gsub(",", "", x)

# Convert to numeric and sum
return( sum(as.numeric(y)) )
}
```

```{r}
xray.sum <- comma.sum(stats$X.ray)
em.sum <- comma.sum(stats$EM)
total.sum <- comma.sum(stats$Total)
```

```{r}
xray.sum/total.sum * 100
```

```{r}
em.sum/total.sum * 100
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
total.num <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", stats$Total))
sum(total.num[1:3])/total.sum
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

SKIPPED 

## 2. Visualizing with Mol-star

Explore the HIV-1 protease structure with PDB code: `1HSG`
Mol-star homepage at: https://molstar.org/viewer/. 

![Figure 1. A first view of HIV-Pr](1HSG.png)

![Figure 2. Molecular surface showing binding cavity](1HSG.2.png)

![Figure 3. The catatilically important ASP 25 and drug interacting HOH 308 water molecule](1HSG.3.png)

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

Yes, I can identify it; and this water molecule has the residue number 308. 

## 3. Using the bio3d package in R 

The Bio3D package is focused on structural bioinformatics 
analysis and allows us to read and analyze PDB (and related) data.

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```
We can see atom data with `pdb$atom`: 

```{r}
head( pdb$atom )
```

```{r}
head( pdbseq(pdb) )
```

## Molecular Visualization in R

We can make quick 3D viz with the `view.pdb()` function:

```{r}
library(bio3dview)
library(NGLVieweR)

#view.pdb(pdb) |>
  #setSpin()

#view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor = "pink", colorScheme = "sse")
```

```{r}
sel <- atom.select(pdb, resno=25)

#view.pdb(pdb, cols=c("green", "orange"),
#         highlight = sel, 
#         highlight.style = "spacefill") |>
#  setRock()
```


## Predicting functional motions of a single structure

We can finish off today with a bioinformatics prediction of the functional motions of a protein. 

We will run a Normal Mode Analysis (NMA)

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

```{r}
#view.nma(m)
```
We can write out a trajectory of the predicted dynamics and view this in Mol-star

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="nma.pdb")
```

```{r}
202990/252188522 * 100
```
So we only know 0.8% of the structures. Tiny coverage of structure based.
