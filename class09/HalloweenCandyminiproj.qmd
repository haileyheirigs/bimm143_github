Today we will take a wee step back to some data we can taste and explore the correlation structure and principal components of some Halloween candy. 

```{r}
candy_file <- "candy-data.csv"

candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset? 

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset? 

```{r}
candy$fruity
table(candy$fruity)
```

## What is your favorite candy?

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it's `winpercent` value? 

```{r}
candy["Almond Joy",]$winpercent
```

```{r}
candy["Twix",]$winpercent
```

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat",]$winpercent
```

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars",]$winpercent
```


## Exploratory Analysis 

We can use the **skimr** package to get a quick overview of a given dataset. This can be useful for the first time you encounter a new dataset. 

```{r}
skimr::skim(candy)
```

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

It looks like the last column `candy$winpercent` is on a different scale to all the others. 

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

I think the zero and one represent whether or not the candy in question is a chocolate or not. So the 0 means it is not chocolate, and the 1 means the candy is chocolate. 

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent) +
  geom_histogram(bins=10, fill="lightpink")
```


> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```

From using the median as the center of distribution, the center is below 50%. 

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
choc.inds <- candy$chocolate == 1
choc.candy <- candy[ choc.inds, ]
choc.win <- choc.candy$winpercent
mean(choc.win)

fruit.inds <- candy$fruit == 1
fruit.candy <- candy[ fruit.inds, ]
fruit.win <- fruit.candy$winpercent
mean(fruit.win)
```

```{r}
fruit.win <- candy[ as.logical(candy$fruity),]$winpercent
mean(fruit.win)
```

On average, chocolate candy is ranked higher than fruit candy. 

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
ans <- t.test(choc.win, fruit.win)
ans
```
Yes, there is a statistically significant difference between these two, due to the p-value. 
/
Yes with a P-value of `r ans$p.value`. 

```{r}
ans$p.value
```


## Overall Candy Rankings

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set? 

There are two related functions that can help here, one is the classic `sort()` and `order()`

```{r}
x <- c(5,10,1,4)
sort(x)
```

```{r}
order(x)
```

```{r}
inds <- order( candy$winpercent)
head( candy[inds,], 5 )
```

> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
tail( candy[inds,], 5 )
```

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent, decreasing = T)
head( candy[inds,], 5)
```

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

Make a bar plot with ggplot and order it by winpercent values 

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder( rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder( rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill="red")
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(x=winpercent, y=reorder( rownames(candy), winpercent),
      fill=chocolate) +
  geom_col()

```

Here we want a custom color vector to color each bar the way we want - with `chocolate` and `fruity` candy together with whether it is a `bar` or not. 

```{r}
mycols <- rep("grey", nrow(candy))
mycols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"
mycols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "pink"
mycols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "brown"

mycols
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(x=winpercent, y=reorder( rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=mycols)

ggsave("mybarplot.png", width=3, height=6)
```

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Sixlets

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starburst

## 4. Winpercent vs Pricepercent 

```{r}
# Pink and grey is too light, lets change to red and black 
mycols <- rep("black", nrow(candy))
mycols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "red"

library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=mycols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=mycols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 8)
```

>Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Reese's Miniatures

>Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```

Nik L Nip, Nestle Smarties, Ring Pop, Hershey's Krackel, and Hershey's Milk Chocolate are among the top 5 most expensive candies. The least popular among these is Nik L Nip. 


## Correlation Structure

```{r}
cij <- cor(candy)
cij
```

```{r}
library(corrplot)

corrplot(cij)
```

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Chocolate and fruity are negatively correlated 

```{r}
round( cij["chocolate", "fruity"], 2)
```

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

```{r}
round( cij["chocolate", "winpercent"], 2)
```


## Principal Component Analysis 

We need to be sure to scale our input `candy` data before PCA as we have the `winpercent` column on a different scale to all others in the dataset. 

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=T)
summary(pca)
```
First main result figure is my "PCA plot"

```{r}
#pca$x
mycols <- rep("black", nrow(candy))
mycols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"
mycols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "red"
mycols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "brown"

ggplot(pca$x) + 
  aes(PC1, PC2, label=rownames(pca$x)) +
  geom_point(col=mycols) + 
  geom_text_repel(max.overlaps = 6, col=mycols) + 
  theme_bw()
```

The second main PCA result is in the `pca$rotation` we can plot this to get a so-called "loadings" plot. 

```{r}
#pca$rotation
ggplot(pca$rotation) +
  aes(PC1, rownames(pca$rotation)) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
#pca$rotation
ggplot(pca$rotation) +
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(pca$rotation), PC1), fill=PC1) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

All the ones in the fruity category, and they do make sense.
