# Class 11: Comparative structure analysis
Hailey Heirigs (PID: A16962278)

Load up the pacckages we will need for analysis of protein structure
sets.

``` r
library(bio3d)
```

We will analyze the ADK starting with a single ADK database accession
code: “1ake_A”

``` r
id <- "1ake_A"
aa <- get.seq(id)
```

    Warning in get.seq(id): Removing existing file: seqs.fasta

    Fetching... Please wait. Done.

``` r
aa
```

This is better but still difficult to see what is similar and different
in all these structures or indeed learn much about how this family
works.

Let’s try PCA:

``` r
pc <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc)
```

![](Class11Comparative-Structure-Analysis_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)

``` r
plot(pc, pc.axes = 1:2)
```

![](Class11Comparative-Structure-Analysis_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)

``` r
view.pca(pc)
```

Write a PDB “trajectory” for mol-star

``` r
